    <p>Hey, I'm Jack Traversa and I am currently a first year student studying CS at Rose-Hulman Institute of
      Technology.
      I don't have much practical experience yet, but I am enjoying the process of learning several programming
      languages (Java is my favorite so far) and all the different math concepts
      required to excel in this field.
    </p>

    <p>I hope my future projects implement biology (specifically genetics), which is the only subject that rivals my
      passion for CS. There is still so much about the subject that is unknown and it would be amazing to contribute to
      a greater
      understanding of our genes and chromosomes. That being said, I currently plan on working towards a minor in
      Molecular Genetics.
    </p>

    <p>Outside of academics, I've trained in American Kenpo since 5th grade, working my way up to earn my first-degree
      black belt right before college started.
      I taught the curriculum throughout my junior and senior years of highschool, working at the studio I had trained
      at for all those years prior. It was a fun way to give back to my community and I'm really grateful to have had
      the opportunity.
