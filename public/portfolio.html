      <p id="oops">As a freshman, and as someone who hadn't done much coding prior to college, I have only worked on one
        project. To fill in some of the gaps, I'll showcase some bits of code from my courses that I found to be
        interesting or enjoyable.</p>
      <li>
        <h2><a href="#">JavaSwing Joyride</a></h2>
        <img src="images/javaswing joyride.png" alt="A picture of the JavaSwing Joyride game while being played">
        <p>My only actual project was implemented using JavaSwing, where I worked in a group to mimic the graphics and
          gameplay of
          'JetPack Joyride' including collision logic.
          This was the final project for CSSE 220 and earned a high A.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2><a href="#">Binary Search Trees</a></h2>
        <img src="images/project2.png" alt="Some code for traversing through a Binary Search Tree">
        <p>I'm currently taking CSSE 230, which is my first time encountering trees. I'm sure they will get more
          difficult, but I feel good about my understanding of them so far and I think it is pretty cool how there are
          multiple ways to implement them.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2><a href="#">File I/O in C</a></h2>
        <img src="images/project3.png" alt="Some code in C relating to files">
        <p>In CSSE 132, where we coded in C, it was difficult getting used to a new editor and language. I still haven't
          reached the same level of confidence that I feel for Java. That being said, I think it is cool that C is more
          conscious of memory.</p>

        <h2><a href="#">Favorite Things</a></h2>
        <img src="images/project4.png" alt="A picture of a website with a color changer and number incrementer">
        <p>Here's one of the homeworks that I recently completed for this class. Javascript is definitely going to take
          some getting used to, but I was able to get my desired results pretty quickly. I do find this class more
          satisfying than some of my other coding classes, as I'm actually making stuff rather than simply passing test
          cases.</p>
